<h1>W. J. ZENG - Themes Appearing in Turn</h1>

<em>"And every science, when we understand it not as an instrument of power and
domination but as an adventure in knowledge pursued by our species across the
ages, is nothing but this harmony, more or less vast, more or less rich from
one epoch to another, which unfurls over the course of generations and
centuries, by the delicate counterpoint of all the themes appearing in turn,
    as if summoned from the void."</em><br>
- Alexandre Grothendieck, RÃ©coltes et Semailles<br><br>

Here are some themes that I have encountered. I'm almost
certain to leave them unfinished.
<br><br>

And there are certainly others that I don't even know myself.
The ink of a
handwritten word is unaware of its own meaning too.
<br><br>

But here's a short record of ones I know about. Your patience is appreciated.
<br><br>
I'm always up for discussions on these topics
<a href="https://twitter.com/wjzeng">@wjzeng</a>.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSrb1cnKiE8B507Nub9IXK2d3wF3x7PP8_EFf2HbUJc/edit?usp=sharing">
    Here's some background
    reading</a>.
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Mathematics is the science of cognition. It is a testable model of what
        rules are cognitively universal (for humans and similar intelligences).
        It is less different from the other sciences than many think.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Mathematics is a large distributed artwork, crafted across <a
            href="quotes.html#generations">generations</a>. Increasingly
        it will be developed by software.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>The physics of reality can be derived from information
        theoretic constructions, i.e. I subscribe to "It from Bit". Future
        theories of physics will be theories of information (like quantum
        mechanics already is). Quantum computers and derived technologies will
        play a key role in exploring these foundations.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>The most important impact of quantum computers will be widespread
        understanding by users of how different reality is from
        classical/Newtonian models of the world. This will fundamentally
        change how humanity as a whole conceptualizes reality.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Whether the multiverse is real is the most important ethical question
        for humanity today.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Language made from concatenated symbols will eventually
        be superseeded by embodied languages. Expressive technologies will do
        more than our voice or our pens or our keyboards can do today.
        Emojii's and videochat are a precursor form. With VR/AR coupled to
        brain-computer interfaces, the "words" of our languages will become
        increasingly more complex. We will hyperlink between gestures.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>This shift in language will eventually also cause a shift in our
        mathematics. Mathematics will remain formal but will become embodied in
        systems. We will gain advantages from mapping mathematical reasoning
        into the evolved human intuition for manipulating
        physical objects. String diagrams in monoidal categories are a
        precursor version of this.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Unification by an information theoretic foundation for
        the world will eventually lead to creative technologies that influence
        reality more profoundly then anything we can imagine today.
        <highlight>Eventually this will collapse the distinction
            between thought and reality</highlight>.
        But not by denying reality with a simulation! Instead by
        embracing and unifying the two. Fiction is the closest thing we have to
        such a technology today. From
        some point of view the eventual "it from bit" theory will be a more
        powerful tool for composing fiction than we have ever yet imagined.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Science has historically been a decentralized autonomous organization.
        In the coming years, adopting DAO tooling for science (DeSci), including
        new market mechanisms, will accelerate progress.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Aliens can be vastly more divergent beings from us than is often
        appreciated.
        Not just physically but cognitively. We need an understanding of
        cognition that is broad enough to grasp beings whose mathematics has
        vastly divergent axioms from our own. In the same way that the
        science of the
        natural world has different subfields, an alien's cognition could
        introduce us to a totally new field of mathematics. Perhaps our
        mathematics covers the cognitive version of thermodynamics and theirs
        covers general relativity.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>The mass slaughter of animals for food is fundamentally unethical.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Intelligence/cognition is a performative and context dependent behavior
        and not an innate property. <highlight>One day the inanimate/animate
            distinctions that we hold so strongly to today will become
            unimportant prejudices
        </highlight>.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Today's economics seems based on real-valued totally ordered
        preferences. What economics could we build out of other systems?
        This is an analogous question to the exploration of different formal
        logics.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>A social evolution occurred when laws became written.
        Another evolution will occur when legal systems become computable.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Is teleportation of particles with mass possible? This question lies
        intersects "bits" (which we already can quantum teleport in limited
        ways) with "its" i.e. matter.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Why do so many of us live physically separated from kindred spirits?
        How can we build/rebuild community living in the future of the West?
    </li>
    <br><br>
    <li>How can we live regeneratively with nature?</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>Is consciousness a
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blindsight-Peter-Watts/dp/0765319640">
            bug and not a feature?</a></li>
    <br><br>
