    <!-- About -->
    <p><strong>I work to make quantum computing useful, sooner, and for more people. </strong>
        My tools are quantum computer architecture and quantum software/algorithm
        engineering.
    </p>

    <p>I run a quantum technology research group at Goldman Sachs as well as
        the <a href="http://unitary.fund">unitary fund</a>, a non-profit research group helping
        create a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people.
    </p>

    <p>Previously, I was at <a href="http://rigetti.com" target="_blank">rigetti</a> quantum
        computing, where I worked on topics across research, product and strategy. I was product lead for
        building and launching rigetti's quantum cloud service on top of its superconducting QPUs and the
        <a href="http://forest.rigetti.com" target="_blank">forest</a>
        quantum programming toolkit, including the open source libraries
        <a href="https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil" target="_blank">pyquil</a>
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/rigetticomputing/grove" target="_blank">grove</a>. My
        quantum instruction set of choice is
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355" target="_blank">quil</a>. My
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08062" target="_blank"> phd thesis</a>
        at oxford applies abstract methods (mainly from categorical algebra) to the
        study of quantum algorithms and protocols. Before that I worked with superconducting
        qubit systems at
        <a href="http://qulab.eng.yale.edu/" target="_blank">yale</a>

            Quantum computing is an emerging computational paradigm with vast potential. This course is an introduction
            to modern quantum programming for students who want to work with quantum computing technologies and learn
            about new paradigms of computation. A physics / quantum mechanics background is not required. The course
            covers the model of quantum computation, quantum programming languages, hybrid quantum/classical
            programming, quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, and applications. The course is hands on using
            open source Python packages for working with publicly available quantum processors.
            <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: linear algebra and programming at the undergraduate level. <br>

        In December, the team at Rigetti became the first to solve an unsupervised machine
        learning problem on a gate model quantum computer. We did this by connecting one of
        our recent superconducting quantum processors, a 19-qubit system, to our software
        platform, Forest. In the ten weeks since then, researchers have already used Forest
        to train neural networks, program benchmarking games, and simulate nuclear physics.
        <br><br>
        Starting today, researchers using Forest will be upgraded to version 1.3, which
        provides better tools for optimizing and debugging quantum programs. The upgrade
        also provides greater stability in our quantum processor (QPU), which will let
        researchers run more powerful quantum programs...

        The first scalable universal quantum computers are now available, such as the 19
        qubit processor built by Rigetti Computing. As these devices mature, it is
        important to consider how best to make use of them. This requires new and applied
        programming models for quantum computing. In particular, promising near-term
        algorithms for quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning require a
        hybrid quantum/classical programming environment. In this talk, we introduce a
        freely available open-source environment (<a href="http://forest.rigetti.com">Forest</a>)
        based on a shared-memory intermediate representation
        (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355"> Quil</a>) that is optimized for
        this hybrid model. The environment runs through a cloud API with client-side Python
        libraries that target both superconducting quantum circuit and classical simulation
        backends. We will share how to get started with Forest, as well as how to do
        research with example hybrid algorithms using a quantum computer.

        We outline three developments that are needed over the next five years to ensure
        that the first quantum computers can be programmed to perform useful tasks. First,
        developers must think in terms of 'hybrid' approaches that combine classical and
        quantum processors. For example, at Rigetti we have developed an interface called
        Quil, which includes a set of basic instructions for managing quantum gates and
        classical processors and for reading and writing to and from shared memory. Second,
        researchers and engineers must build and use open-source software for
        quantum computing applications. Third, scientists need to establish a
        quantum programming community to nurture an ecosystem of software. This community
        must be interdisciplinary, inclusive and focused on applications.

        We describe a scalable functional architecture for superconducting quantum computation, based on a
        planar lattice of transmon and fluxonium qubits, parametric amplifiers, and a novel fast DC
        controlled two-qubit gate.

        We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum
        computations---including compilation---along with a quantum instruction
        language called Quil for explicitly writing these computations. With this formalism,
        we discuss concrete implementations of the machine and non-trivial algorithms
        targeting them. The introduction of this machine dovetails with ongoing development of
        quantum computing technology, and makes possible portable descriptions of recent
        classical/quantum algorithms.
        This instruction set architecture is the basis for the quantum programming platform

        Gauge color codes are particularly interesting quantum error correcting codes because the admit a
        universal logical gate set through gauge fixing. We study the threshold of gauge color codes using
        Markov-chain Monte Carlo decoding.

        <h2>The Abstract Structure of Quantum Algorithms</h2>

    <p class="abstract">

        <br><br>
        Quantum information brings together theories of physics and computer science. This
        synthesis challenges the basic intuitions of both fields. In this thesis, we show that
        adopting a unified and general language for process theories advances foundations and
        practical applications of quantum information. Results include new blackbox quantum algorithms,
        generalized quantum secret sharing and contextuality protocols, a categorical analysis of the
        Fourier transform in process theories, and an algorithm for natural language processing with a quantum
        computer. The main mathematical tools used in this thesis are group theory (esp. Fourier theory on
        finite groups), monoidal category theory, and categorical algebra.

        This work applies contextuality (a mathematical formalism developed in quantum mechanics)
        to models of social choice theory. In essence, we mathematically characterize when it makes sense to
        consider the choices of a group as composed of individual choices, finding an interesting link between
        no-signaling theories and the weak axiom of revealed preference.

        This paper studies the categorical structure of quantum algorithms with oracles to develop a new

        discuss an application to the categorical theory of signal-flow networks.
