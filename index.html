                In December, the team at Rigetti became the first to solve an unsupervised machine
                learning problem on a gate model quantum computer. We did this by connecting one of
                our recent superconducting quantum processors, a 19-qubit system, to our software
                platform, Forest. In the ten weeks since then, researchers have already used Forest
                to train neural networks, program benchmarking games, and simulate nuclear physics.
                <br><br>
                Starting today, researchers using Forest will be upgraded to version 1.3, which
                provides better tools for optimizing and debugging quantum programs. The upgrade
                also provides greater stability in our quantum processor (QPU), which will let
                researchers run more powerful quantum programs...

                The first scalable universal quantum computers are now available, such as the 19
                qubit processor built by Rigetti Computing. As these devices mature, it is
                important to consider how best to make use of them. This requires new and applied
                programming models for quantum computing. In particular, promising near-term
                algorithms for quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning require a
                hybrid quantum/classical programming environment. In this talk, we introduce a
                freely available open-source environment (<a href="http://forest.rigetti.com">Forest</a>)
                based on a shared-memory intermediate representation
                (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355"> Quil</a>) that is optimized for
                this hybrid model. The environment runs through a cloud API with client-side Python
                libraries that target both superconducting quantum circuit and classical simulation
                backends. We will share how to get started with Forest, as well as how to do
                research with example hybrid algorithms using a quantum computer.

                Machine learning techniques have led to broad adoption of a statistical model of 
                computing. The statistical distributions natively available on quantum processors 
                are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this attribute has the 
                potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely 
                classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is learning to hybridize 
                classical computing resources and traditional learning techniques with the emerging 
                capabilities of general purpose quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate such 
                hybridization by training a 19-qubit gate model processor to solve a clustering 
                problem, a foundational challenge in unsupervised learning. We use the quantum 
                approximate optimization algorithm in conjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian 
                optimization to train the quantum machine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm 
                shows robustness to realistic noise, and we find evidence that classical optimization 
                can be used to train around both coherent and incoherent imperfections.

                We outline three developments that are needed over the next five years to ensure
                that the first quantum computers can be programmed to perform useful tasks. First,
                developers must think in terms of 'hybrid' approaches that combine classical and
                quantum processors. For example, at Rigetti we have developed an interface called
                Quil, which includes a set of basic instructions for managing quantum gates and
                classical processors and for reading and writing to and from shared memory. Second,
                researchers and engineers must build and use open-source software for
                quantum computing applications. Third, scientists need to establish a
                quantum programming community to nurture an ecosystem of software. This community
                must be interdisciplinary, inclusive and focused on applications.

                We show that parametric coupling techniques can be used to generate selective
                entangling interactions for multi-qubit processors. By inducing coherent population
                exchange between adjacent qubits under frequency modulation, we implement a
                universal gateset for a linear array of four superconducting qubits. An average
                process fidelity of F=93% is estimated for three two-qubit gates via quantum
                process tomography. We establish the suitability of these techniques for
                computation by preparing a four-qubit maximally entangled state and comparing the
                estimated state fidelity against the expected performance of the individual
                entangling gates. In addition, we prepare an eight-qubit register in all possible
                bitstring permutations and monitor the fidelity of a two-qubit gate across one pair
                of these qubits. Across all such permutations, an average fidelity of F=91.6±2.6%
                is observed. These results thus offer a path to a scalable architecture with high
                selectivity and low crosstalk.

                We propose and implement a family of entangling qubit operations activated by
                radio-frequency flux pulses. By parametrically modulating the frequency of a
                tunable transmon, these operations selectively actuate resonant exchange of
                excitations with a statically coupled, but otherwise off-resonant, neighboring
                transmon. This direct exchange of excitations between qubits obviates the need for
                mediator qubits or resonator modes, and it allows for the full utilization of all
                qubits in a scalable architecture. Moreover, we are able to activate three
                highly-selective resonances, corresponding to two different classes of entangling
                gates that enable universal quantum computation: an iSWAP and a controlled-Z
                rotation. This selectivity is enabled by resonance conditions that depend both on
                frequency and amplitude, and is helpful in avoiding frequency crowding in a
                scalable architecture. We report average process fidelities of F = 0.93 for a
                135 ns iSWAP, and F = 0.92 for 175 ns and 270 ns controlled-Z operations.

                Recent progress on quantum computing hardware, especially in superconducting qubit
                systems, highlights the need for practical programming models and tools for these
                first devices. In particular, many near-term applications are quantum/classical
                hybrid algorithms, that treat the quantum computer as a co-processor. In this
                workshop, we introduce
                <a href="http://forest.rigetti.com">Forest</a>,
                an open source quantum programming toolkit targeting near-term
                applications and devices. This toolkit includes an intermediate quantum instruction
                language (Quil) and Python libraries for generating and executing Quil code in
                either a simulated environment or on a quantum processor.

                Quantum computing devices based on superconducting quantum circuits have rapidly
                developed in the last few years. The building blocks-superconducting qubits, quantum-limited
                amplifiers, and two-qubit gates-have been demonstrated by several groups. Small prototype
                quantum processor systems have been implemented with performance adequate to demonstrate
                quantum chemistry simulations, optimization algorithms, and enable experimental tests of
                quantum error correction schemes. A major bottleneck in the effort to develop larger systems
                is the need for a scalable functional architecture that combines all the core building blocks
                in a single, scalable technology. We describe such a functional architecture, based on a planar
                lattice of transmon and fluxonium qubits, parametric amplifiers, and a novel fast DC
                controlled two-qubit gate.

                We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum
                computations---including compilation---along with a quantum instruction
                language called Quil for explicitly writing these computations. With this formalism,
                we discuss concrete implementations of the machine and non-trivial algorithms
                targeting them. The introduction of this machine dovetails with ongoing development of
                quantum computing technology, and makes possible portable descriptions of recent
                classical/quantum algorithms.

                We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural
                language processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate
                grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In (Coecke,
                Sadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model)
                based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages,
                its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources
                that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC
                approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to
                existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum
                RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun
                and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new
                algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions.

                Gauge color codes are topological quantum error correcting codes on three dimensional
                lattices. They have garnered recent interest due to two important properties: (1) they
                admit a universal transversal gate set, and (2) their structure allows reliable error
                correction using syndrome data obtained from a measurement circuit of constant depth.
                Both of these properties make gauge color codes intriguing candidates for low overhead
                fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recent work by Brown et al. calculated a threshold
                of ~0.31\% for a particular gauge color code lattice using a simple clustering decoder
                and phenomenological noise. We show that we can achieve improved threshold error rates
                using the efficient Wootton and Loss Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) decoding. In the
                case of the surface code, the MCMC decoder produced a threshold close to that code's
                upper bound. While no upper bound is known for gauge color codes, the thresholds we
                present here may give a better estimate.

                Quantum information brings together theories of physics and computer science. This
                synthesis challenges the basic intuitions of both fields. In this thesis, we show that
                adopting a unified and general language for process theories advances foundations and
                practical applications of quantum information. Our first set of results analyze quantum
                algorithms with a process theoretic structure. We contribute new constructions of the Fourier
                transform and Pontryagin duality in dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We then use this
                setting to study generalized unitary oracles and give a new quantum blackbox algorithm for
                the identification of group homomorphisms, solving the GROUPHOMID problem. In the remaining
                section, we construct a novel model of quantum blackbox algorithms in non-deterministic
                classical computation. Our second set of results concerns quantum foundations. We complete
                work begun by Coecke et al., definitively connecting the Mermin non-locality of a process
                theory with a simple algebraic condition on that theory's phase groups. This result allows
                us to offer new experimental tests for Mermin non-locality and new protocols for quantum secret
                sharing. In our final chapter, we exploit the shared process theoretic structure of quantum
                information and distributional compositional linguistics. We propose a quantum algorithm adapted
                from Weibe et al. to classify sentences by meaning. The clarity of the process theoretic setting
                allows us to recover a speedup that is lost in the naive application of the algorithm. The main
                mathematical tools used in this thesis are group theory (esp. Fourier theory on finite groups),
                monoidal category theory, and categorical algebra.

                Recent work on the logical structure of non-locality has constructed scenarios
                where observations of multi-partite systems cannot be adequately described by
                compositions of non-signaling subsystems. In this paper we apply these frameworks
                to economics. First we construct a empirical model of choice, where choices are
                understood as observable outcomes in a certain sense. An analysis of contextuality
                within this framework allows us to characterize which scenarios allow for the possible
                construction of an adequate global choice rule. In essence, we mathematically
                characterize when it makes sense to consider the choices of a group as composed of
                individual choices. We then map out the logical space of some relevant empirical
                principles, relating properties of these contextual choice scenarios to no-signalling
                theories and to the weak axiom of revealed preference.
